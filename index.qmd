Hello! My name is Joseph Abdelmalek. I am a Junior at Harvey Mudd College studying Engineering, with a focus in Biomedical Engineering. My academic career has led me to many useful and interesting classes like Continuum Mechanics, Experimental Engineering and now MicroPs! I am also a research student in Prof. Santana's CuTE Lab, where I help parametrize and test a 3D bioprinter. Outside of classes, I enjoy playing club volleyball for the Claremont Colleges team and teaching Coptic hymns classes and Sunday School at my home church in Irvine.
