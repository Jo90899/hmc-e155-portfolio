    "text": "For Lab 4, my goal was to use our MCU’s peripheral timers to alternate a pin given a certain frequency. This would be done by having those timers create signals in the form of square wave unit steps, or basically turning the signal on and off for varying amounts of time. This would allow us to play sounds from a speaker attached to the output pin, which could then be used to play music given a set of notes. The question now lies in our title: “Where is Lab 4?”\nThis week we worked on creating our own custom PCBs to use in our temperature lab, Lab 6. We were tasked with watching some prep tutorial videos before class lectures so that we could work on the PCBs in class as needed. However, this was not as simple as I thought. The videos we watched were made using KiCad v4, while the KiCad version I downloaded was KiCad v8. Because of this, lots of steps and names for things in the videos were different. I spent a lot of time over the week trying to find the proper way to complete the steps in the tutorial for this updated version, resulting in significantly less time for Lab 4. I did learn something from it though: 1. Never Assume! I thought the videos would be quick… they were not… 2. Start Early! In the future, when I get assigned something, I should start it right away, even if I don’t finish it so that I can estimate how long it may take me. 3. PCBs! I did manage to make my own PCB this week which is awesome. Definitely want to do more of this in the future. It was fun!"

    "text": "For E155 Lab 2, I was tasked with building on my skills from Lab 1, as well as learning how to use time multiplexing to my advantage. While putting the pieces of the software together, I noticed that I spend a lot of time redoing or reorganizing my setup due to a lack of pre-implementation mapping. Taking a step back, it seems the best way to move forward with labs like these is to spend some time in front of a whiteboard and just throw my thoughts down. This could definitely help me find potential errors or easier solutions before I implement.\nUsing skills from lectures, like writing out input-output tables and drawing FSM State Transition Diagrams/Tables has proven useful for this lab. The lab definitely seems to get easier when I draw things out like this. Additionally, time multiplexing seems like a great way to save “space” with our MCU and FPGA. This is definitely something I want to explore and maybe include in my project for E155."

    "text": "E155 (also known as “MicroPs”) is an upper-division elective at Harvey Mudd intended to expand our knowledge of digital design (FPGAs and microcontrollers) in order to allow us to build our own embedded systems. This class is very hands-on and lab-oriented: as such, much of the learning in this class comes from putting our knowledge to practice and learning from our (many) mistakes.\nAs for my learning objectives, it is not as simple as saying I want to learn more about digital design. In order to do this, I have to be willing to try and fail so that I can learn from my mistakes. I hope that through this class, I gain the confidence to try my best and accept that failure will happen. I hope to learn that failure is not a step backward, but instead a new clue to finding my way forward."

To do this, I first had to consider the LED power draw and how much current would flow through each cathode, so as to make sure the segments all lit up at the same brightness level. Each cathode on the display needed to be connected to the breadboard adapter (and ultimately ground), so we had to include a resistance in this connection. In addition, because of Kirchhoff’s Current Law, the resistors all must be the same because current will flow through the path of least resistance (same resistance will result in even flow). Looking at the datasheet, I found that the voltage required to power a segment was 2.1 V and the ideal current was 20 mA So:\n\\[\nR=\\frac{V_i-V_f}{I}=\\frac{3.3-2.1}{0.02}=60 \\textnormal{ Ohms}\n\\]\nGiven this, I chose a resistor close to 60 Ohms (68 Ohms).

    "title": "E155 Lab 2: Multiplexing 7-Segment Display",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Lab Overview\nIn this lab, the goal was to use the seven-segment display module from Lab 1 to power a dual seven-segment display. However, instead of running two separate modules and taking up double the space, the goal for this lab was to practice time-multiplexing, a technique used to share a hardware resources for different purposes. In addition to this, we also needed to set up LEDs to take the sum of the two digits that were given as inputs. This display would be able to sum the two hexadecimal digits at all times (regardless of multiplexing) and display the binary sum on 5 LEDs. The instructions for this lab can be found on the HMC E155 Website under Lab 2\n\n\nDiscovering Multiplexing\nThe first step in completing this lab was understanding and mapping out how to multiplex our signal. This was done by creating an input and output table for the multiplex module and then creating a state transition diagram. This diagram (shown below) indicates that in states 1 and two, we wait for a counter variable C before switching. When the counter has reached a certain limit, it will indicate a change in state and then reset to 0 and start over again. This counter is what we will use to determine the multiplex speed, making sure that it is fast enough to seem like two simultaneous signals to the naked eye but slow enough to prevent the values of the digits from bleeding through to the other digit.\n\n Figure 1: State transition diagram for the multiplexing module.\n\nNow that this was mapped out, I moved into designing my top module and identifying the modules I needed inside it. Drawing it out below, I used 4 modules within my top module: an HSOSC module (which is done within the top module and instantiates the clock), an LED sum module, the multiplex module from above, and my original (and unchanged) seven-segment display module from Lab 1.\n\n Figure 2: State transition diagram for the multiplexing module.\n\n\n\n\nInputs\nOutputs\n\n\n\n\nclk, reset\nd1, d2\n\n\n[3:0] n1, n2\n[4:0] sum\n\n\n\n[6:0] seg\n\n\n\nFrom here, I was able to write my SystemVerilog in Radiant. See that code here.\n\n\nQuesta/ModelSim Testing\nGiven this, I was able to write up my top and submodules and test them in Questa/ModelSim using testbenches. Multiple test benches were written so as to be able to test each module individually and the top module as well. The top module was able to tell the most in one image, shown below.\n\n Figure 3: State transition diagram for the multiplexing module.\n\nFrom the image, we see that our LED sum module works correctly and we also see that when the digit indicator is low at d1, the illuminated digit is the first digit (n1). We see this when n1 is “7” and our segment outputs “1111000” which is low (indicating the light is on) for segments A, B, and C.\n\n\nCircuit Design and Calculations\nAfter confirming that the FPGA works as intended in simulation, I then had to set up the hardware. Below is an image with the FPGA pins and display pins, along with locations of resistors labeled R_0, R_1, and R_3.\n\n Figure 4: Schematic showing pin numbers and mapping of the FPGA-to-display/LED communication.\n\nTo calculate the resistor values for the FPGA connections to the seven-segments on the display, I made sure the current was less or equal to the maximum allowable current dictated by the FPGA datasheet given the voltage drop dictated by the display datasheet. From there I was able to calculate:\n\n Figure 6: Calculations for the dual seven-segment display cathode resistors.\n\nFor the transistors, given the voltage drop indicated in the datasheet, I was able to calculate:\n\n Figure 7: Calculations for the transistor connection resistors.\n\nFor the LEDs that displayed the sum, I used an LTA-1000hr display and from the datasheet, I was able to calculate:\n\n Figure 7: Calculations for the LEDs that display the sum’s resistors.\n\n\n\nLights!\nWith the hardware designed, I implemented my plans, completed the circuit, and programmed my FPGA. I was able to display these successful outputs:\n\n Figure 8: Image of the dual seven-segment display showing the proper multiplexed outputs 4 and 3. The sum is also correct (00111)\n\n\n Figure 9: Image of the dual seven-segment display showing the proper multiplexed outputs d and 7. The sum is also correct (10100).\n\nHere. you’ll find a video of some more combinations. In the video you will notice that the setup looks slightly different. When playing around with more combinations, I found that in certain cases, the LEDs would not output the correct sum and the seven segment display for digit #2 would flicker and be incorrect. When I ran my finger over the Upduino board, specifically around P6, the LEDs and display would flicker more and then adjust to the right input. I later found that the connection from P6 on the development board to the ribbon cable connecting it to the breadboard looked corrupted/broken. When changing the input of the second DIP switch from P6 to P42, one of the secondary input pins on the development board, all the broken combinations had been fixed and the display and LEDs worked perfectly. Check out the video below!\n\nFigure 7: Video showing the working seven-segment display. (Between 3 and 4 on the second digit, the DIP switch was pushed slightly off the board. After pushing it back in, it resumed working).\n\n\nSummary\nIn sum, I was able to create a working dual seven-segment display and I was also able sum the outputs on LEDs. Most of the time I spent on this lab was getting the seven-segment display pins right. A large part of this lab needed organization and mapping so as to help make debugging quicker and easier. Going forward, drawing out the pin locations, state transition diagrams, etc. will prove to help me move along and figure the labs out much quicker. In total, this lab took me about 12 hours."

In addition to setting them up, we were tasked with using them to create a 7-segment display that could display a single hexadecimal digit. For this lab, I was able to complete the setup and test for the MCU and FPGA, however I was unable to complete the display as I ran out of time during the week.\nMost of the time I spent on this lab was debugging and setup. For me, this took longer than average because in my mind, the physical aspect of the project had no need for debugging, and I focused fully on trying to debug the software. When running the provided demos for the FPGA and MCU, I looked for errors in my downloaded drivers/packages or my code files. However, my problem during this lab came from a few poorly-soldered pins on the development board. Because of this, I learned that the best way to attack a problem when you have no direction is to start at the beginning and never assume you know where to go. Although I was unable to get to the 7-segment display, I was still able to learn a valuable skill that will help me in the future labs and projects.\nLooking ahead at the final task for this lab that I have yet to complete, I feel confident that I can attack it and solve it. During lectures, we spent time reviewing key concepts such as combinational and sequential logic and how to approach problems that require us to create modules for FPGAs. We also looked at ways not to write Verilog, which will help me avoid errors and extended debugging."

However when looking at hardware, everything was not as it seems. Currently I am playing around with my simulations to see where I can break it to figure out what is going wrong.\nThe reason I am choosing to mess with simulation instead of the hardware is because I previously had an issue where even though my simulation was set up correctly, I ran into timing issues. Because I had set my counter too high, my testbench changed values too fast to get picked up by the next state logic block. Hopefully, I am able to find something soon!"
